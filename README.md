## About the Video Course
This is the second course in the series on Ansible and in this course, we will be focusing on advanced concepts in Ansible and some real-life use cases. This course is for those with a basic understanding of Ansible who are willing to gain expertise in developing with Ansible. Ansible is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy. Avoid writing scripts or custom code to deploy and update your applicationsâ€” automate in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to install on remote systems.
